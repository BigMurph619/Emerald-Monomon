# Core Game Rules

You must only use 1 Pokemon for all fights and encounters except double battles unless otherwise denoted.  
NOTE: There is no "Brawlbuddy rule" in this mode.

Permadeath: If your primary Pokemon faints, the game is over.

No Shopping: **Except for any type of Pokeball or Repel.**

You can only use items that you pick up, find as a held item on Pokemon or are given by an NPC.

Select 3 “Favorites” prior to each run. These Pokemon are subject to the 555 BST or under rule.

Stolen Items: You may not keep stolen items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc.  
**Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine.**

You may not intentionally kill a wild Pokemon for EXP unless game progression requires you to do so, depicted in a specific game rule [(refer to rule 3)](#specific-game-rules) or it is a Shiny Pokemon.

No Redos: You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means (See rule __ for Camera Crew). You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once

No HM Moves on your primary Pokemon.

You can only enter a dungeon once with your primary Pokemon unless the story requires a revisit.
You may not use healing stations in Dungeons. Exceptions: Weather institute (after clearing Team Aqua) and Route 11 rest house so long as you are not poisoned and have sufficient repels to make it to the Pokemon Center. This is simply for quality of life during the mid game.
You must clear (Game progression without leaving to heal) Dungeons before exiting (Beat All Trainers in Gyms clear needed game progress elsewhere).

You **DO NOT** have to let your Pokemon Evolve.

You may only hold consumable held items.

All shinies are free catches or kills.

# Settings

Use a 60% level boost to Foe and Wild Pokemon instead of 50%. The Randomizer program has a hard limit of 50%, thus a workaround is required to reach 60%:
First load the vanilla Emerald ROM (or patched ROM) and apply this settings string:

321WRIEEjL8AP8AAgGRAAKeBhsECQEACQACCQAuEgAAAAAABBC45ATkAYYICTIGBAIyGQUgC0VtZXJhbGQgKFUpXhJeD+PDOIo=

Click "Randomize (Save)". This is your new "Source ROM"
Now you have a ROM ready to use the Murphmon setting strings below
Load the "Source ROM" from step 2 into the randomizer, then load the Murphmon string below
Randomize (Save). You're ready to play.

Randomize the game. 

All Pokémon, movesets, and items are randomized.

All Pokemon must have Fluctuating Growth Rates. 

All opponents must have Smart AI(requires patch or SmartAI randomizer). 

BOSS and IMPORTANT trainers must have sensible and consumable held items.

All move tutors and TMs must be randomized. 

Static Pokémon MUST NOT have level increase. 

`No "Make Evolutions Easier".`

Forced Fully Evolved at Level 30. 

All Boss trainers must have 3 additional Pokemon.

Catch Rate set to "5" (100% Catch Rate)

# Specific Game Rules

1. You may pick any mon you want in the bag that is 555 BST or lower. You may keep its held item. **No legendaries allowed.** If you evolve into a Pokemon that is over 555 BST, you may use that Pokemon so long as it aligns with Ability rules.

2. All items and moves are allowed in the initial wild fight AND rival fight.

3. Pivoting:
    - You may catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area prior to the Aqua Grunt in the forest (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and bag mon. You may keep items held by these Pokemon. 
    - You must pivot before the Aqua Grunt in the forest. You may fight trainers freely prior to the Aqua Grunt. You may NOT pivot again.
    - You may receive EXP from 1 wild mon prior to fighting the Aqua Grunt but you MUST run the mon that received EXP and avoid receiving additional EXP from wilds at all costs. 
    - You may use any Mon at the front of your party until you lock in your pivot. (If a mon dies of poison outside of battle AND you have another Pokemon in your party the run may continue but the poisoned Pokemon is Permadead)
    - You may catch 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. 
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon).

5. All hidden items are allowed.

6. All found, traded and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed. - **No HMs.**
    - You may only relearn Sketch once from the move relearner.
    - You may use Sketch multiple times if you receive the move in any other capacity.
    - Please note that there are 100% catch rates in Monomon, so throwing balls will not work to scout moves. You may use flutes so long as they don't impact the battle (i.e. wake up sleep, cure confuse, etc.) to scout moves for Sketch.

7. You must fight Brawley before traveling north of Slateport

8. You may fight the trainers in the Soda Shack AND obtain the Sodas.

11. "Tate and Liza Lad" You must use the gifted weather institute "Castform" as you second Pokemon for the Tate and Liza fight. You may use this Pokemon and its turns freely (so long as they align with all other non-doubles rules).

15. Double battles: You may NOT attack with your second Pokemon. All abilities, however, are allowed. You may fight the camera crew once per location.

16. All held items found on pivot options/HM friend catches are allowed to be kept. "Catch and release" mon held items are not allowed. 
    - Purchased/gifted mon's items are not allowed i.e. Weather Institute Castform. 
    - You may not catch a wild mon unless it is a pivot option, Shiny, or needed for HM friend.
